Characteristics of C Language:
1) Keywords
2) Operators
3) Seperator
4) Constant
5) Pre-defined Functions
6) Syntax
   •What are Keywords?
   > Keywors refers to those words of C language that has a reserved meaning or pre-defined meaning. Keywords shouldn't be used as identifiers or names of variables.
   Example: int, char, double, short, float, etc.
   •What are Operators?
   > Operators are special symbols used to perform specific task. There are about 44 operators.
   And are broadly classified as unary, binary, ternary, etc.
   •What are Separator?
   > They are things that are used to separate a C Token.
   Example: blank space, semi-colon, comma, etc.
   •What are Constants/Literals?
   > Constant refers to those values that remains fixed throughout the programme.
   They are classified as below:
     i) Alpha-Numeric
     ii) Numeric constant {0-9}
       Again Alpha-Numeric are classified as:
       i) character constant e.g. 'f', '5', '@', etc.
       ii) String constant e.g. "mobashir", "comp_854", etc
       And Numeric constants are categorised as:
       i) Integer constant [Numbers without a decimal point]
       ii) Floatin Point constant [Numbers with a decimal point]
   •What are Pre-defined Functions?
   > Those functions that are readily available to the programer.
   • Sytax refers to the grammar of writting code in C language. It refers to the rules for the structure of C Program.
   Example: Syntax for Declaratin of a variable :
             data-type variable_name;
           Every statement in C program terminates at a ssemi-colon.
